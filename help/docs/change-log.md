# Change Log

## Background

### Versioning

H2O Nitro follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Minor and patch releases should never contain breaking
changes.

When referencing the [`h2o-nitro` package](https://pypi.org/project/h2o-nitro/) from your `requirements.txt`
or `setup.py`, you should always use a version constraint such as `>=4.2, <5` (any version 4.2 or greater, but less than
5), since major releases of H2O Nitro do include breaking changes.

### Support Policy

For LTS releases, bug fixes are provided for 2 years and security fixes are provided for 3 years. These releases provide
the longest window of support and maintenance. For general releases, bug fixes are provided for 6 months and security
fixes are provided for 1 year.

## v0.14.0

Aug 15, 2022

**Warning: This release has several breaking changes.**

The major focus for this release was to support arbitrary styles for boxes, and reducing the code clutter typically
associated with mixing presentation and behavioral logic.

- Added
    - Support for applying arbitrary styles using [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) notation. Note that Nitro does
      not use the official Tailwind library, but includes an entirely custom incremental compiler that expands and
      applies styles on the fly.
    - Concise styling notation: `box(...) / style` is equivalent to `box(..., style='')`.
    - Extensible styles: `box(...) / a / b` is shorthand for `box(..., style=f'{a} {b}')`.
    - Extensible boxes: `box(x, y)(p, q)` clones a box and puts `p` and `q` in it.
    - Support for rendering SVG graphics.
    - Dozens of examples for custom components like cards, stats, pagination, etc. built using pure Python.
- Changed
    - Typography and color handling have been completely overhauled.
    - Markdown styling has been completely overhauled. Now uses Tailwind's `prose` styles.
    - `box(style=)` now controls how a box looks, and replaces individual settings like `tile`, `width`, `color`, and so
      on.
      A box can have several styles, e.g. `box(style='p-4 grow text-blue-500'`).
    - `box(mode=)` controls how a box behaves, and replaces individual flags like `multiple`, `required`, and so on. A
      box
      can have several modes, e.g. `box(mode='required multi menu')`.
    - `view(insert=, remove=, inside=, before=, at=, after=)` replaced with `view.add(at=)`, `view.clear(at=)`.
    - `box([options...])` now can be used to create any picker that accepts options, not just buttons.
    - Themes have been simplified. Instead of specifying background, foreground and accent colors, you only need to
      specify
      light/dark modes and an accent color.
    - `view.jump()` opens URLs in a new window (instead of the current window).
    - `view.jump(target='_self')` opens URLs in the current window.
    - `box(title=)` is now interpreted as a collapsible group.
    - `row(box(title=), ...)` is now interpreted as a tabbed view.
    - `col(box(title=), ...)` is now interpreted as a vertical tabbed view (not as an accordion view).
- Removed
    - `box(items=[a, b, c])` removed. Use `box(a, b, c)` instead, i.e. `box()` is now variadic.
    - `box(row=)` removed. Use `row()` or `col()` instead.
    - `box(layout='column')` removed. Use `mode='vertical'` instead.

    - `box(live=)` removed. Use `mode='live'` instead.
    - `header(width=)` removed. Use `style='min-w-* max-w-*'` instead.
    - `header(resizable=)` removed. Use `mode='fixed'` instead.
    - `header(multiline=)` removed. Use `mode='multiline'` instead.
    - `view(before='foo')` removed. Use `view(at=':foo')` instead.
